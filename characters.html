                    <h2>Michael - Judge of Loweland</h2>
                    <p>Michael always loved to experiment. Inspired by the technology from Elle City, he developed a new technology - golems. In his spare time, he tries to improve his technology, and sometimes he makes himself little golem buddies.</p>
